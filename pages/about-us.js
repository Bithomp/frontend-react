        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>
          Bithomp was created in 2015 when its founder noticed a lack of user-friendly XRPL explorers and wanted to
          contribute to the ecosystem by creating such a tool. The communityâ€™s response was positive from the start,
          allowing Bithomp to grow quickly. From its origins as a hobby project to its transition into a full-time
          endeavour, Bithomp has been driven by community support and a commitment to user-friendly tools.
