        <h1>What Are Blackholed Addresses on {explorerName}?</h1>
        <p>
          Blackholed addresses are {explorerName} wallet addresses from which funds can never be retrieved or spent.
          These addresses are <strong>permanently unmanageable</strong>, making it impossible to sign transactions from
          them. As a result, any {nativeCurrency} held in these addresses is permanently removed from circulation and{' '}
          <strong>no more tokens can be issued from them</strong>. Blackholed addresses can be created intentionally for
          specific purposes or occur unintentionally due to various reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          One primary reason for blackholing an account is to prevent misuse or unauthorized access. This is
          particularly important for token issuers who want to ensure that{' '}
          <strong>no one can modify token settings or freeze assets</strong> after issuance. By blackholing the issuing
          account, they demonstrate that the token supply is <strong>immutable and free from central control</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An account becomes blackholed by <strong>disabling the master key</strong> and{' '}
          <strong>setting its regular key to a special publicly known blackholed address</strong> like{' '}
          <Link href="/account/rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrBZbvji">rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrBZbvji</Link>. If{' '}
          <strong>no active signer list</strong> is assigned, the account is completely inaccessible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Letâ€™s view one of the examples of a blackholed account and how it is highlighted on our website. As you can
          see, we mention that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>this account is blackholed,</li>
          <li>when exactly it was blackholed,</li>
          <li>its master key is disabled,</li>
          <li>its regular key is set to one of the special publicly known addresses on {explorerName}.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Special Addresses on {explorerName}</h1>
        <p>{explorerName} includes several publicly known blackholed addresses:</p>
        <p>
          1. Address:{' '}
          <strong>
            <Link href="/account/rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrhoLvTp">rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrhoLvTp</Link>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Name: <strong>ACCOUNT_ZERO</strong>

          {xahauNetwork ? 'xahaud' : 'rippled'} as the issuer for {nativeCurrency} in peer-to-peer communications.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Address:{' '}
          <strong>
            <Link href="/account/rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrBZbvji">rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrBZbvji</Link>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Name: <strong>ADDRESS_ONE</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Meaning: The base58 encoding of the value 1 in the {explorerName}. Used as a placeholder for the issuer of a
          trust line balance in RippleState entries.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Address:{' '}
          <strong>
            <Link href="/account/rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrNAMEtxvNvQ">rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrNAMEtxvNvQ</Link>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Name: <strong>Ripple Name Black-hole</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Meaning: Previously used by Ripple to reserve Ripple Names by requiring users to send {nativeCurrency} to this
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Address:{' '}
          <strong>
            <Link href="/account/rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrn5RM1rHd">rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrn5RM1rHd</Link>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>

          encoding format.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Blackholed addresses serve an important role in the {explorerName} ecosystem by enhancing security, enforcing
          immutability, and affecting the overall token supply. By permanently locking accounts, projects can ensure
          decentralization and prevent unauthorized modifications. While blackholing is a useful tool, it should be done
          with careful consideration, as the process is irreversible.
