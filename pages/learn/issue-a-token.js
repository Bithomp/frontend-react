          <h2>What Are {explorerName} Tokens?</h2>
          <p>
            {explorerName} tokens (also called ‚Äúissued currencies‚Äù or IOUs) are digital assets created on the{' '}
            {explorerName}. They are fungible, which means each unit of the token is interchangeable with another.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tokens are digital assets on the {explorerName} that can stand in for almost any form of value. They can
            represent real-world assets such as stablecoins like the US dollar, precious commodities, loyalty credits,
            or even simple items like a chair, a cup of tea, or an hour of work.

          <h2>How to Create a Token on {explorerName}</h2>
          <p>Creating a fungible token is simple and doesn‚Äôt require smart contracts. Here‚Äôs the basic process:</p>
          <ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 1</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Decide what kind of token you want ‚Äî and whether you actually need one. Start by choosing a name. </p>
            <li>If it‚Äôs a utility token, you can issue as many as you like.</li>
            <li>
              If you want a limited supply, you can blackhole the issuing account so that no additional tokens can ever
              be created. <Link href="/learn/blackholed-address"> Learn more about Blackholed Addresses.</Link>
            </li>
            <li>If you plan to issue tokens continuously, it‚Äôs best to use a hardware wallet (such as Ledger).</li>
            üëâ You can get your Ledger Wallet{' '}
            <Link href="https://shop.ledger.com/?r=8aeb&tracker=iou_issuer">here</Link>.
            <p>
              <strong>Step 2</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Set up TWO accounts ‚Äì one will issue the token (ISSUER ACCOUNT), the other will hold and distribute it
              (CURRENCY DESTRIBUTION ACCOUNT).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 3</strong>
            </p>
            Fund both accounts with {nativeCurrency} ‚Äì each account must meet the {nativeCurrency} reserve requirement.
            <p>
              <strong>Step 4</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Enable the <span className="bold">Default rippling</span> on the <span className="bold">ISSUER</span>{' '}
              ACCOUNT. You can do it on the <Link href="/services/account-settings">Account Settings page</Link> (under
              the <span className="bold">Advanced Options</span>).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 5</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Create a trustline ‚Äì the receiving account (CURRENCY DESTRIBUTION ACCOUNT) must explicitly trust the
              issuing account to hold its token. This trustline must be created with <i>Rippling</i> enabled. You can do
              it <Link href="/services/trustline?mode=advanced&noRipple=false">here</Link>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 6</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Send a payment transaction ‚Äì the ISSUER ACCOUNT sends a payment of the new token to the CURRENCY
              DESTRIBUTION ACCOUNT.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 7</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Follow the guidence to register your token and make it representable.{' '}
              <Link href="/learn/guide-for-token-issuers">Guidence for token issuers.</Link>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 8</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Users can now create trustlines to your ISSUER ACCOUNT to hold your token. You can share a link to Simple
              mode (where Rippling is disabled). Get your Trust Set link for your token{' '}
              <Link href="/services/trustline">here</Link>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 9</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now you can distribute your token from the CURRENCY DESTRIBUTION ACCOUNT. You can send payments, create
              orders on DEX

                <>
                  {' '}

            </p>
          </ul>
          <h3>Why Trustlines Are Important?</h3>
          <p>
            A trustline is a built-in safety feature. Users must opt in to accept a token from a specific issuer. This
            prevents spam and ensures that you only hold tokens from sources you trust. For example, users will likely
            trust {xahauNetwork ? 'EVR issued by Evernode' : 'RLUSD issued by Ripple'} more than tokens issued by an
            unknown individual.
          </p>
          <h2>Common Scenarios for {explorerName} Tokens</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Meme or Community Tokens</strong>
            </li>
            <p>Often the first step for new projects. Fun, simple, and great for community engagement.</p>
            <li>
              <strong>Fiat-Backed Stablecoins</strong>
            </li>
            Banks or payment providers can issue fiat-backed stablecoins. The recommended setup uses:
            <ul>
              <li>A cold (issuer) account ‚Äì the secure account that creates tokens.</li>
              <li>A hot (operational) account ‚Äì the account that distributes tokens to customers.</li>
              This model protects the issuer while enabling smooth day-to-day operations.
            </ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Fixed Supply Tokens</strong>
            </li>
            Communities or projects can issue tokens with a capped supply. Once distributed, the issuer account can be
            blackholed (keys destroyed), ensuring that no additional tokens can ever be minted.
          </ol>
          <h3>What You Can Do With Your {explorerName} Token</h3>
          <p>Once issued, your {explorerName} token is a full participant in the network:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Trade it on {explorerName}‚Äôs decentralized exchange (DEX) </li>
            <li>Swap it for {nativeCurrency} or other issued assets </li>
            <li>Use it in loyalty or community programs</li>
            <li>Store and transfer it using {explorerName}-compatible wallets </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For unique assets such as artwork, collectibles, or event tickets, you can issue NFTs on {explorerName}{' '}
            instead of fungible tokens.

          <h3> Advantages of {explorerName} for Tokenization </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Speed ‚Äì transactions settle in 3‚Äì5 seconds</li>
            <li> Low fees ‚Äì {xahauNetwork ? '0.000027 XAH' : '0.000012 XRP'} </li>
            <li> No smart contracts needed ‚Äì tokenization is a native feature</li>
            <li>Security through trustlines ‚Äì users choose which tokens to hold</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Creating a token on {explorerName} is fast, secure, and cost-efficient. Whether you‚Äôre building a memecoin,
            stablecoin, loyalty program, or governance system, {explorerName} provides the tools to do it with minimal
            complexity.
