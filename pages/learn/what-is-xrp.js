                    <p>
                        <strong>XRP</strong> is a digital asset designed for fast, low-cost international payments.
                        It plays a key role in the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized blockchain built for financial use cases.
                        Unlike many cryptocurrencies that focus on general-purpose computing or store-of-value use, XRP is optimized for moving value efficiently across borders.
                    </p>

                    <h2>XRP as a Digital Asset</h2>
                    <p>
                        At its core, XRP is a <strong>cryptographic token</strong> used on the XRP Ledger.
                        It enables secure, trustless transfers of value in seconds, with minimal fees â€” often fractions of a cent.
                        The XRP Ledger operates without mining and reaches consensus via a unique validator network, offering scalability and energy efficiency.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Use Cases: Payments and Liquidity</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Cross-Border Payments</strong>
                            <p>XRP is widely known for its use in cross-border money transfers. Financial institutions can use XRP as a bridge currency, enabling instant settlement between different fiat currencies without the need for pre-funded accounts.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Liquidity Provision</strong>
                            <p>By holding XRP, financial entities can tap into on-demand liquidity. This reduces the need to hold various fiat currencies in multiple countries and simplifies treasury operations.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Micropayments & Transfers</strong>
                            <p>Due to its low transaction costs and fast settlement, XRP is also suitable for micropayments, remittances, and streaming payments.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>XRP Tokenomics</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Total supply:</strong> 100 billion XRP tokens were created at launch.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>No mining:</strong> All tokens exist from the beginning; new XRP is not created over time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Deflationary aspect:</strong> A small amount of XRP is burned as a transaction fee, permanently removing it from circulation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Distribution:</strong> The initial supply was distributed by Ripple Labs, which continues to hold a significant portion, released gradually from escrow.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
