                    <p>
                        The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain engineered for fast, low-cost, and scalable digital payments.
                        Since its launch in 2012, XRPL has powered a range of financial use cases, including payments, tokenization, and decentralized finance (DeFi).
                        Unlike proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin, XRPL is designed to settle transactions in seconds using an energy-efficient consensus mechanism.
                    </p>

                    <h2>üìò Decentralized Ledger Basics</h2>

                    <p>
                        At its core, XRPL is a <strong>distributed ledger</strong>‚Äîa database replicated across a global network of independent nodes.
                        Each node stores a copy of the entire transaction history and uses cryptographic protocols to ensure data integrity and consistency.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unlike centralized financial systems controlled by single entities, the XRP Ledger is governed by consensus rules enforced by this decentralized network.
                        Anyone can operate a node, view the ledger, and submit transactions.
                    </p>

                    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è How XRPL Consensus Works</h2>
                    <p>
                        XRPL does <strong>not use mining</strong>. Instead, it relies on a unique consensus algorithm known as the <strong>Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA)</strong>. Here's how it works:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Trusted Validators</strong>: Each node maintains a list of trusted validators (called a Unique Node List or UNL).</li>
                        <li><strong>Proposal Rounds</strong>: Validators propose new transactions in rounds and compare them with others.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agreement Threshold</strong>: Once 80% of validators agree on a transaction set, it is validated and added to the ledger.</li>
                        <li><strong>Finality</strong>: This process ensures near-instant finality‚Äîtransactions are confirmed in ~3‚Äì5 seconds.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        This consensus model makes XRPL energy-efficient and extremely fast compared to traditional blockchains.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Account Structure & Transactions</h2>

                    <p>
                        Each user on XRPL operates through an <strong>account</strong>, identified by a public address. Accounts can:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Hold XRP and other issued tokens</li>
                        <li>Send and receive transactions</li>
                        <li>Set trust lines to accept non-XRP tokens</li>
                        <li>Configure advanced features like multi-signing or payment channels</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Transaction types supported include:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Payments</strong> (XRP or tokens)</li>
                        <li><strong>TrustSet</strong> (establishing trust lines)</li>
                        <li><strong>OfferCreate</strong> (placing orders on the decentralized exchange)</li>
                        <li><strong>Escrow</strong>, <strong>Checks</strong>, and <strong>AccountSet</strong> for advanced operations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        All transactions consume a small amount of XRP as a fee, which is permanently destroyed‚Äîmaking XRP slightly deflationary over time.
