            Crypto is moving towards decentralization, where people want more control over their assets without relying
            on centralized companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase or Binance, you deposit money via bank transfer, card, or
            crypto. But the moment you deposit, you don‚Äôt actually control your assets anymore ‚Äî the exchange does. Your
            trades happen off-chain in their system, and you rely on them to approve withdrawals.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, a decentralized exchange (DEX) lets you trade directly from your own wallet. You always
            hold your private keys and never give up control of your funds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The key difference:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>CEX</strong>= the exchange holds your money
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DEX</strong>= you hold your money
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Enter AMMs</h2>
          <p>
            An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a type of DEX that uses algorithms and liquidity pools to make trading
            seamless. Instead of needing a buyer and seller to match instantly, you trade against a pool of assets.
          </p>
          <p>With AMMs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Prices are set by math, not humans</li>
            <li>You trade against liquidity pools, not individual traders</li>
            <li>Transactions are instant, without waiting for order matches</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>AMMs vs. Order Book DEXs</h2>

          <p>AMMs make it possible to trade even rare tokens that would be too illiquid in an order book.</p>
          <h2>How Liquidity Pools Work</h2>
          <p>
            Think of a self-running stall at a market. The prices adjust automatically depending on supply and demand.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users called liquidity providers (LPs) deposit equal values of two tokens into a pool.</li>
            <li>Traders swap tokens in and out of the pool.</li>
            <li>LPs earn a share of trading fees, proportional to their share of the pool.</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="p-4 my-4 border-l-4 rounded bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 border-[#4BA8B6] shadow-sm">

              pools and start earning fees.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h2>LP Tokens</h2>
          <p>
            When you add liquidity, you don‚Äôt just leave tokens behind ‚Äî you receive LP tokens. These represent your
            share of the pool. Later, you can withdraw your liquidity anytime.
          </p>
          <div className="p-4 my-4 border-l-4 rounded bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 border-[#4BA8B6] shadow-sm">

          <h2>Impermanent Loss</h2>
          <p>
            Impermanent loss (IL) happens when the value of your deposited tokens changes compared to when you first
            added them. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúimpermanent‚Äù because it only becomes permanent when you withdraw.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Key points:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Small price movements ‚Üí small IL (usually less then 2%)</li>
            <li>Fees you earn can often cover IL XRPL‚Äôs</li>
            <li>Continuous Auction mechanism helps further reduce IL for liquidity providers</li>

          <h2>XRPL‚Äôs AMM (XLS-30)</h2>
          <p>The XRP Ledger‚Äôs AMM (XLS-30) introduces unique features that improve on traditional AMMs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Fee Voting</strong> ‚Äì LPs can vote on pool trading fees, making it community-driven.

              impermanent loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DEX (Order Book) + AMM Interoperability</strong> ‚Äì You can use both AMM pools and the traditional
              XRPL order book for the best liquidity.

          <h3>Auction Rewards </h3>
          <p>A unique feature of XRPL‚Äôs AMM is the continuous auction. Here‚Äôs how it works:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Traders can bid to temporarily ‚Äúrebalance‚Äù a pool by providing one token in exchange for another at
              slightly better rates.
            </li>
            <li>The highest bidder wins the auction and gets access to those improved rates.</li>
            <li>The auction proceeds (the difference they pay) are distributed back to liquidity providers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This system creates extra income for LPs and helps offset impermanent loss. In short,{' '}
            <strong>auction rewards = bonus earnings for LPs on top of trading fees.</strong>
          </p>
          <h2>Benefits of XRPL‚Äôs AMM </h2>
